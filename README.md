Indoor Rink Jumbotron Project

Java source code for creating a simple GUI and data stream that interfaces with an ESP32/Arduino embedded system for an indoor jumbotron. 

The project was completed overnight in a "hackathon" environment, so may not make use of coding best practices and system design due to the time limitation (which was part of the idea of the project).
